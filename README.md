## Why?
AsyncStorage not fulfilling promise on Android 7+<br>
I hope this problem will be solved, but issue https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14101 was created  at 22 May 2017. <br>
Today 15 Apr 2018<br>
This is very quickly solution for android

Just replace
```javascript
import {AsyncStorage} from 'react-native'
```
 to
 ```javascript
 import AsyncStorage from 'rn-async-storage'
```
 .. thats all! :)

For ios you can use all function of AsyncStorage

### sorry but only works
 - setItem(key, value)
 - getItem(key)
 - getAllKeys()
 - removeItem(key)
 - clear()
 - multiSet(keys[])
 - multiGet(keys[])

If you need other methods from AsynStorage let me know

For ios you can use all function from AsynStorage
